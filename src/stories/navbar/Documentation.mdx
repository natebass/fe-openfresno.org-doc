# Navbar

The default navigation bar for the application. It includes an extended menu that expands to show more text underneath the navbar.

### Experimental Features ⚠️

**Fade on Scroll:**

This effect uses CSS scroll-driven animations. **It is not supported by older browsers** (e.g., Chrome < 115, Firefox, Safari). On unsupported platforms, it functions the same as if fade were set to false.

**Sliding Underline:**

The desktop links have a sliding underline animation when the page navigates.

## Props

- fade \{boolean\} - Whether to enable the fade effect on scroll.
